# EXML 2 LUA
A tool for converting EXML files - the No Man's Sky game data file format, generated by [MBINCompiler](https://github.com/monkeyman192/MBINCompiler "MBINCompiler") - to a lua table and back.
The tool handles full files or specific sections. It can load the data to memory directly or write it to a text file as a ready-to-use lua script.
## Exml-as-lua table format
Every section in its own table, and each section has a `meta` table describing its attributes. The `att` item in the meta table will be `name`, `value`, or the named attribute.
Using these rules, the following describes a string class section:
```lua
{
    meta = {att='ZoomLevels', val='GcZoomData'},
    ZoomType = 'Mid',
    EffectStrength = 1.0,
    MoveSpeed = 10.0,
    FoV = 40.0,
    MinScanDistance = 5.0,
    MaxScanDistance = 70.0
}
```
An ordered list, like a colour class must have each property in its own table:
```lua
{
    meta = {att='name', val='Colour'},
    {R = 0.917},
    {G = 0.192},
    {B = 0.032},
    {A = 0.6}
}
```
Technology/product requirement, containing a sub-section for inventory type, class:
```lua
{
    meta = {att='name', val='Requirements'},
    {
        meta = {att='Requirements', val='GcTechnologyRequirement'},
        ID = 'LAND1',
        Amount = 100,
        Type = {
            meta = {att='Type', val='GcInventoryType'},
            InventoryType = 'Substance'
        }
    }
}
```
With this format can describe any EXML data.
